What's 60 degrees in radians?

---

π / 3

===

What is an arcsecond?

---

It's `1/60 * 1/60` of a degree *(1/60 of an arcminute)*

= **1/3600 of a degree**

===

What is Kepler's Third Law (two things)?

---

Kepler's Third Law states that for all satellites of the same host:

= **T^2 ∝ R^3**

= Years ^ 2 ∝ AU ^ 3

And we know that **T = R ^ 1.5**

===

What are Newton's 3 laws?

---

1. Law of intertia: constant speed unless external force is applied
2. F = ma
3. Every action has an equal and opposite reaction

===

What are the 3 laws of Thermodynamics?

---

1. Conservation of energy: **∆E = ∆Q - ∆W**
2. Entropy in an isolated system always increases
3. Entropy approaches a constant as temperature reaches absolute zero

===

How do you calculate parallax distance?

---

Distance to object = ( distance from midpoint of baseline / parallax angle in radians )

===

What's the inverse square law for light?

---

Brightness ∝ 1 / distance ^ 2

===

What's the difference between brightness and luminosity?

---

Luminosity is the amount of light the star emits at its surface.

(Apparent) brightness is how bright is looks from a given distance (how much light we receive).

===

What is one AU?

---

One AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth (centre to centre).

===

What's a parsec?

---

A parsec is the distance to a star that we observe with a parallax angle of 1 arcsecond.

≈ 3.26 lightyears

===

How can we measure one AU using Venus?

---

We can bounce a radio signal off Venus (and measure the response time) to get the distance from us to Venus.

Then we can 

===

What's the speed of light?

---

3x10^8 m/s

≈ 10 G ly / 10 G years

===

What is Power (Watts)?

---

Power (W) = energy (j) / second (s)

===

What is a newton metre?

---

1 newton metre = 1 joule

===

How does work done relate to kinetic energy?

---

W = F * d

= kinetic energy = (1/2) m v^2

===

What is one kcal in joules?

---

1 kcal = 4.2 kj (kilo joules)

===

How do we model conservation of momentum?

---

MV = mv

===

How do you find gravitational potential energy?

---

F = m * g

===

What is g?

---

g = 9.8 m/s/s

===

What is G?

---

G = 6.67 x10^-11 *(N m^2) / (kg^2)*

===

How do you find angular velocity?

Angular velocity = v / r

*= distance / time*

= 2π / T

===

How do you find angular momentum?

---

Angular momentum L = I * angular velocity

*where I = momentum of intertia*

===

How did we figure out heat?

---

1. **Rumford** noticed heat couldn't be a fluid bc cannon balls heat up when being bored from cast
2. **Joule** noticed heat must be a form of energy with his pulley experiment
3. **Wimmiam Thompson** developed the field of thermodynamics 
4. Thompson's colleague **Rankine** first invented the idea of conservation of energy

===

Where does angular momentum come from in the universe?

---

Spin is accelerated as objects get smaller.

So when the universe was formed as giant clouds of gas, angular momentum was conserved when these clouds collapsed into stars and galaxies. And spin accelerated as they become smaller elements like stars and planets.

===

How do you find surface gravity on a planet?

---

g = GM / r^2
