# Learning SQL & Postgres

> What's your primary source of knowledge for this?

The Odin Project's [free course](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/databases/) on databases and SQL.

> What's your previous experience with this?

Well... I've used [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) (a document database) and [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) (a graph database) before, but my experience with relational databases (like Postgres and MySQL) is embarassingly sparse.

It's time to change that.
