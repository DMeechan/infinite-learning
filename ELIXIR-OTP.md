# Elixir - OTP

> What's OTP?

It's the **Open Telecom Platform**. It's a set of libraries which ship with Erlang (and therefore Elixir).

> Why do I care? 

OTP lets you built robust, fault-tolerant applications. It runs most of the telecom networks, so it's pretty stable :D

> How do I learn it?

The [official Elixir guide](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/mix-otp/introduction-to-mix.html) is a pretty solid place to start. It runs you through creating a distributed key-value store.

Someone on ElixirForum wrote a [short guide](https://elixirforum.com/t/should-we-separate-ecto-from-phoenix-in-umbrella-app/1515/13) on how they create umbrella applications.

And ElixirSchool has a [great guide](https://elixirschool.com/en/lessons/advanced/concurrency/) which explains how OTP concurrency, supervisors, distribution and umbrella projects work in Elixir. 100% recommended reading.
