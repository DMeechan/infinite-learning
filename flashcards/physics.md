===

What are the 3 laws of Thermodynamics?

---

1. Conservation of energy: **‚àÜE = ‚àÜQ - ‚àÜW**

===

How do you calculate parallax distance?

---

Distance to object = ( distance from midpoint of baseline / parallax angle in radians )

===

What's the inverse square law for light?

---

Brightness ‚àù 1 / distance ^ 2

===

What's the difference between brightness and luminosity?

---

Luminosity is the amount of light the star emits at its surface.

(Apparent) brightness is how bright is looks from a given distance (how much light we receive).

===

What is one AU?

---

One AU is the distance from the Sun to Earth (centre to centre).

===

What's a parsec?

---

A parsec is the distance to a star that we observe with a parallax angle of 1 arcsecond.

‚âà 3.26 lightyears

===

How can we measure one AU using Venus?

We can bounce a radio signal off Venus (and measure the response time) to get the distance from us to Venus.

Then we can 

===

What's the speed of light?

1 kcal = 4.2 kj (kilo joules)

===

How do we model conservation of momentum?

---

MV = mv

===

How do you find gravitational potential energy?

F = m * g

===

What is g?

---

g = 9.8 m/s/s

===

What is G?

---

G = 6.67 x10^-11 *(N m^2) / (kg^2)*

===

How do you find angular velocity?

Angular velocity = v / r

*= distance / time*

= 2œÄ / T

===

How do you find angular momentum?

---

Angular momentum L = I * angular velocity

*where I = momentum of intertia*

===

How did we figure out heat?

---

1. **Rumford** noticed heat couldn't be a fluid bc cannon balls heat up when being bored from cast
2. **Joule** noticed heat must be a form of energy with his pulley experiment
3. **Wimmiam Thompson** developed the field of thermodynamics 
4. Thompson's colleague **Rankine** first invented the idea of conservation of energy

===

How do you find surface gravity on a planet?

---

g = GM / r^2

===

Draw a Herzberg-Russell diagram (with axes and the various groups)

---

===

Why does surface temperature of a star affect its colour?

---

Because if the star has more energy (due to higher temperature), it will emit more energy at shorter wavelengths (like blue).

===

Why do starts at the top left of the HR diagram diefirst, even though they have the most mass to burn through?

---

Stars with a lot of mass are huge in size and are super hawt üî•, so a huge quantity of fusion is occurring. This means the brightest, most massive stars burn the most and quickly die üíÄ

===

If giants are red, why are they so bright? üí°

---

Despite not being super hot, giants have huge surface area (hence the name). So they have many square meters available to emit light

===

What two criteria must a hypothesis meet?

---

1. Must be testable üî¨
2. Must be possible to be proven wrong ‚ùå

===

How do you find density?

---

Density = mass / volume

===

What are the IS units?

---

- Meter `m`
- Kilogram `kg`
- Second `s`
- Kelvin `K`
- Ampere `A`
- Mole
- Candela `cd`

===

Where does angular momentum come from in the universe?

---

Spin is accelerated as objects get smaller.

So when the universe was formed as giant clouds of gas, angular momentum was conserved when these clouds grouped together into stars and galaxies. When these massive clouds of gas collapse into smaller structures, their spin accelerates.

===

How old is the universe?

---

The universe is around 14 billion years old.

===

What elements are produced in stars?

---

Stars initially only form helium (from hydrogen). When they expand into red giants, however, they're able to huse helium atoms to form heavier elements like carbon, oxygen, iron (especially more massive stars). 

===

How do elements heavier than iron get produced?

---

We get elements heavier than iron (like uranium and gold) from supernova explosions. During a supernova explosion, 'neutron capture' reactions take place and form elements which are too heavy to be produced even by fusion (due to the energy requirements to fuse them together).

===

Why do planets closer to the sun contain heavier elements (like iron), while those further away contain lighter elements (like ice)?

---

During the solar system's formation (from a collapsed nebula), a protoplanetary disc was formed (a disc of material) around the Proto-Sun. Clumps of heavier materials (fluid metals and molten rock) came together around the sun and remainded there, until being scooped up into planets. 

Meanwhile, the lighter gases escaped from the inner solar system because of the sun's strong heat (?) and moved beyond the Frost Line ‚Ñ¢Ô∏èÔ∏è. From there, they turned into ice and it became possible to form planets from the gases (with a core of liquid hydrogen and helium).

===

What is the period ratio?

---

(P / p) = (A / a) ^ 1.5

How do you find the blackbody temperature of something?

---

`T = 278 * (L ^ 1/4) / (R ^ 1/2)`

===

How do orbit areas relate to orbit times?

What does eccentricity mean?

---



===

How does the Earth's eccentricity vary?

---



===

How do you draw a greenhouse effect diagram? (exam)

---



===

Why is Earth warmer than its blackbody level?

---

The Earth is warmer than its blackbody level (by maybe 30 degrees?) because of the greenhouse effect.

===

Are the planets evenly spread out?

---

No, the planets are not evenly spread out: Bode's law means their spread is (kinda) logarmithmic
