# Infinite Learning

Hello, adventurer! Welcome to _Infinite Learning_.

> What even is infinite learning?

Infinite Learning is a simple idea: find something outside of your comfort zone (ideally something that would be valuable to you in some way), learn it, and then document what you've learnt.

> Isn't that just blogging with a fancy name?

Yep, I guess you could say that.

> What does this even have to do with code?

I like learning. I like building. And I like sharing what I've learnt. This GitHub repository used to be called `learning-elixir`, but I figured I needed a more generic name so I could add my notes on Docker, DevOps, etc. to it.

_Hmm... what sounds pretty cool? Learning Resources? No. Maximum Knowledge? God no. Infinite Learning? Yeah, that'll do._

> Okay... cool. Where do I sign up?

Just pick your topic. Start learning. And start documenting (GitHub and Medium are great places to post content BTW).

Don't leave the documenting until the end - as the good ol' cliches say: it's about the journey, not the destination.

Good luck, adventurer. It's a curious world out there if you look deep enough.

## The resources I've made (so far)

- [Elixir](./ELIXIR.md)
- [Docker](./DOCKER.md) (work in progress)
- [SQL](./SQL.md) (work in progress)
